## Keybase Plugin

TODO:
-----

* private key management (only public keys are shown, which is fine since they're pairs so private keys get grouped in, but there's no way of knowing what keys are private in the preferences page)
* dedupe search results so already-saved keys show up in the search results as having been so (right now they still say "import key")
* the "import key" button's popover is super borked
* add default picture for keys without a keybase profile
* style the in-composer popover
* remove the .asc extension from decrypted downloads
* add a "this message was decrypted with the key for `___@___.com` above decrypted messages
* tests, I guess?
